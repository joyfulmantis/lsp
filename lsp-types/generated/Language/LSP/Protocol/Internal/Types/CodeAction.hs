{-|
A code action represents a change that can be performed in code, e.g. to fix a problem or
to refactor code.

A CodeAction must set either `edit` and/or a `command`. If both are supplied, the `edit` is applied first, then the `command` is executed.

-}

  { {-|
  A short, human-readable, title for this code action.

  -}
  _title :: Data.Text.Text
  , {-|
  The kind of the code action.

  Used to filter code actions.

  -}
  _kind :: (Maybe Language.LSP.Protocol.Internal.Types.CodeActionKind.CodeActionKind)
  , {-|
  The diagnostics that this code action resolves.

  _diagnostics :: (Maybe [Language.LSP.Protocol.Internal.Types.Diagnostic.Diagnostic])
  , {-|
  Marks this as a preferred action. Preferred actions are used by the `auto fix` command and can be targeted
  by keybindings.

  A quick fix should be marked preferred if it properly addresses the underlying error.
  A refactoring should be marked preferred if it is the most reasonable choice of actions to take.

  @since 3.15.0

  -}
  _isPreferred :: (Maybe Bool)
  , {-|
  Marks that the code action cannot currently be applied.

  Clients should follow the following guidelines regarding disabled code actions:

    - Disabled code actions are not shown in automatic [lightbulbs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_code-action)
      code action menus.

    - Disabled actions are shown as faded out in the code action menu when the user requests a more specific type
      of code action, such as refactorings.

    - If the user has a [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_keybindings-for-code-actions)
      that auto applies a code action and only disabled code actions are returned, the client should show the user an
      error message with `reason` in the editor.

  The workspace edit this code action performs.

  -}
  _edit :: (Maybe Language.LSP.Protocol.Internal.Types.WorkspaceEdit.WorkspaceEdit)

  A command this code action executes. If a code action
  provides an edit and a command, first the edit is
  executed and then the command.

  A data entry field that is preserved on a code action between
  a `textDocument/codeAction` and a `codeAction/resolve` request.
